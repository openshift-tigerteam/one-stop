## OCP4 Install Guides

#### [*Helper Node*](https://github.com/christianh814/ocp4-upi-helpernode)  - Christian Hernandez 
The Helpernode aims to take care of all the pre-intall prerequisites for OpenShift 4.  
It is meant for Lab environments and POCs.  

*Note:*  
The helpernode is a single point of failure. 
To make it HA you need to use keepalived for the haproxy component and add another DNS server as a "slave"
